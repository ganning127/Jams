# Tuning Your Instrument with Google Teachable Machine

![Tuning Your Instrument with Google Teachable Machine](https://i.ibb.co/NtqkCry/Tuning-Your-Instrument-With-Google-Teachable-Machine-1.png)

### Details:
_Outcome:_ Create your own web-app that tells you what note your instrument is playing.

_Requirements:_ iOS or Android Phone (for playing notes), Replit Access (https://replit.com), Google Teachable Machine Access (https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com)

_Language used:_ JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Google Teachable Machine

_Customization opportunity:_ Everyone can train their model to be notes of different instruments (ie guitar, piano, violin, etc.). Sharps and flats can also be added. Additionally, the HTML/CSS/JS of the website can be customized to add extra features (confidence of the model, which note has the highest probability, etc.)

_Platform Limitations:_ Browser-based Replit and Google Teachable Machine Development, so available on all platforms

_Time estimation:_ 45 minutes (I made a workshop on this before, but would love to improve it. The old version is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQjgui5Un-s)

### Breakdown
- Part 0: slides on basics of machine learning (data collection, training, testing, etc.)
- Part 1: find audio samples on YouTube (such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buimPG01gcs)) with different notes (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, sharps/flats)
- Part 2: play those audio samples on your phone in front of your computer's mic to train the Google Teachable Machine audio model to identify different notes (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, sharps/flats)
- Part 3: slides on basics of web dev (html/css/js), not too in depth
- Part 4: fork a replit starter with necessary materials (html/css/js)
- Part 5: export your Google Teachable machine model to JavaScript
- Part 6: write JavaScript to display results from Google Teachable Machine on the page
- Part 7: give everyone next steps on how to further customize
- Hooray!!! Now you've got a web-app that tells you what note your instrument is playing!.
